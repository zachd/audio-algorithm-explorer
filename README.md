# The Shazam Algorithm Explained

An interactive blog post explaining how Shazam's audio fingerprinting algorithm works, complete with live demonstrations and visualizations.

## Features

- **Interactive Audio Processing**: Upload your own audio files and see how they're processed in real-time
- **Live Visualizations**: Watch as your audio is transformed through:
  - Waveform display
  - FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) visualization
  - Spectrogram generation
  - Constellation map creation
  - Hash generation demonstration
  - Noise simulation
- **Educational Content**: Clear, concise explanations of complex audio processing concepts
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
